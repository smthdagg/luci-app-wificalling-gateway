# Changelog

## 1.3.0 - 2026-08-07

- Added local paste-import for AnyTLS, Hysteria2/Hy2, TUIC, VLESS, and VMess share links.
- Maps labels, credentials, TLS/SNI, Reality, WebSocket, UDP, and transport-specific fields into UCI nodes.
- Keeps imported links inside the LuCI browser session and never logs the raw URI.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-08-07

- Replaced per-poll event spam with one-time registration transitions and time-windowed sustained-traffic summaries.
- Requires traffic in three consecutive samples before writing a sustained activity event.
- Added configurable aggregation interval and per-device retention limit (defaults: 60 seconds and 20 records).

## 1.2.0 - 2026-08-07

- Split configuration, live Wi-Fi Calling status, and encrypted IMS activity into separate LuCI pages.
- Added automatic activity refresh, record count, and confirmation-protected log clearing.
- Restricted log write access to this plugin's activity file only.

## 1.1.1 - 2026-08-07

- Fixed LuCI runtime file access on OpenWrt systems where `/var/run` resolves to `/tmp/run`.
- Kept credential-bearing configuration private while exposing only non-secret monitoring data.

## 1.1.0 - 2026-08-07

- Integrated node alive state, measured latency, and quality bands directly into the Proxy nodes grid.
- Removed the duplicate Observed node reachability panel.
- Expanded device monitoring with Wi-Fi Calling registration, ePDG, UDP 500/4500, ASSURED, packet totals, deltas, and last activity.
- Added a capped encrypted IMS activity log while explicitly avoiding unsupported call/SMS identification claims.

## 1.0.1 - 2026-08-07

- Fixed empty LuCI monitoring tables by granting the required read-only `ubus.file.read` permission for the two runtime status files.
- Added a regression test for runtime status ACL access.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-08-07

- First stable release.
- Added AnyTLS, Hysteria2, TUIC, VLESS Reality, and VMess WebSocket nodes.
- Added per-device independent/follow-gateway routing and PassWall coexistence.
- Added node reachability and ePDG/IPsec UDP 500/4500 evidence views.
- Added startup validation, restrictive credential permissions, tests, CI, and bilingual documentation.
